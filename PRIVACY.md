# Privacy Policy for Color-Card Chrome Extension

**Effective Date:** [April 27, 2025]

Thank you for using Color-Card ("the Extension"), a Chrome extension designed to provide easy access to Material Design colors and allow copying their values. Your privacy is important. This Privacy Policy explains what information the Extension handles and how it's stored.

## 1. Information Handled by the Extension

**Color-Card operates entirely locally within your browser. The Extension and its developer DO NOT collect, transmit, or store any personal information or usage data to/on external servers.**

The Extension handles only the following information, stored directly within your browser:

*   **User Preferences:**
    *   **Theme Preference:** Your chosen theme (Light, Dark, or System default) is stored to maintain your visual preference across sessions.

**The Extension DOES NOT collect or access:**
*   Your browsing history.
*   Any URLs you visit (other than the internal `color_card.html` page).
*   Which colors you view or copy.
*   Personal identifiers like your name, email address, or IP address.
*   Any data from webpages you visit.
*   Any other sensitive information.

## 2. How the Extension Uses Information

The *ONLY* information handled (your theme preference) is used exclusively for the following purpose:

*   To apply your selected visual theme (Light, Dark, or System) when you open the Extension's interface.

The Extension **DOES NOT** use this information for tracking, analytics, advertising, or any purpose other than applying your saved visual preference.

## 3. Data Storage

*   **Theme Preference Storage (`localStorage`):** Your selected theme preference ('light', 'dark', or 'system') is stored using the browser's standard **`localStorage`** API. This is a standard web technology for websites and extensions to store small amounts of data directly within the browser.
*   **Local and Private:** Data stored in `localStorage` is **strictly local** to the specific browser profile where the Extension is installed on **your device**. It is *NOT* automatically synchronized across devices (unlike data stored using the `chrome.storage.sync` API, which this Extension **DOES NOT** use).
*   **Accessibility:** This locally stored data is only accessible by the Extension itself and is not accessible to the developer or any third parties.

**All handled data resides within YOUR browser's standard local storage on YOUR devices.**

## 4. Data Sharing

**The Extension and the developer DO NOT collect and (obviously) DO NOT share any information (colors you used or your theme preference) with the developer or any third parties.** The Extension operates entirely locally, and no data is transmitted from your browser to any external servers.

## 5. Security

The Extension relies on the security mechanisms provided by the Google Chrome browser and its standard `localStorage` API to protect the data stored locally.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will update the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of the Extension after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Privacy Policy.
